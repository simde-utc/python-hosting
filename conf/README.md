CONFIG
======

Configuration of the hosting is a bit uncommon. Create a file for each 
variable, and write inside the value.

You can generate all the conf with the script `make_hosting_conf.py`.

Files:

* sites_path.txt: ansolute path to the sites directory, the place where all
the data (code, logs, etc.) will be placed for each site
